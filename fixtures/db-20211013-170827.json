        "description": "In 2006 Daye Bensa Coffee was established by two brothers - Asefa & Mulugeta Dukamo who have been working within the Sidama region in coffee. They operate 16 washing stations and 4 dry mills within Sidama. The Durato Bombe is collected from 626 farmers in Durato of Bombe Kebele (village) in the Bensa Woreda (district) of the Sidama zone. The village shares it's name with the mountain of Bombe on which the coffee grows. Meticulous processing occurs at the Qunqna mill where it is sun dried as whole cherry for 10-15 days creating a fruit-forward and complex flavor profile. \r\n\r\nThis coffee from the Bombe mountain has surprisingly huge body for a natural processed heirloom coffee. Very bright and very sweet, expect notes of blueberry, watermelon, strawberry, and peach.",
