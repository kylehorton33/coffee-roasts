The village shares it's name with the mountain of Bombe on which the coffee grows. Meticulous processing occurs at the Qunqna mill where it is sun dried as whole cherry for 10-15 days creating a fruit-forward and complex flavor profile. \r\n\r\nThis coffee from the Bombe mountain has surprisingly huge body for a natural processed heirloom coffee.

        "description": "Chiapas Turquesa, or turquoise, takes its name from the precious stone—the color of which is spread across the regions, in its incredible waters and vast skies.This coffee comes from across the region, is grown at altitudes between 900 and 1,100 meters, and is characterized by large bean sizes and a round, balanced cup. For decades, Chiapas has been the center of political and ethnic conflicts. The Zapatista movement prevented any large coffee farms from coming into existence, due to their demands for indigenous rights and land access. Consequently, coffee has been cultivated mainly by smallholders, often descendants of Indigenous tribes. These producers plant, harvest and prepare the coffee by hand, sparing no effort to produce coffees they can feel proud of.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that producers receive a fair price, we work closely with the exporters that support these communities with social projects. The exporters also use their own transportation infrastructure to bring the producers’ coffees to market.\r\n\r\nThe harvest season is December through March. All the coffee is received in parchment, quality controlled, and transported to a high tech dry mill in Veracruz. After a second quality check, the coffee is cleaned, milled and sorted to be prepared for export. This coffee has a quality-control standard that allows for only 15 imperfections per 300 grams.\r\n\r\nCupping notes: Milk chocolate, nutty, grape, citrus; medium body, cools sweet.",

Mandehling coffees in general have more of this quality, which can range from wonderful complexity to unpleasant funk in less carefully chosen lots. When I have bought coffees pre-roasted, I avoid Mandehling coffees for fear that the dark roast is covering a bad lot. In home roasting, you can taste the difference, so we choose more carefully.\r\n\r\nA medium bodied cup with bright acidity and the typical \"clay\" earthiness that marks the region. Complexity is refined with notes of orchid and orange and barest grapefruit. Pleasingly light in the mouth but not insubstantial, with very light aftertaste.",
